I wanted to practice OOP programming in JS and prove myself in that language, so I made an Instagram copy

âš™ Technology used:
- Object oriented JS
- Custom Components in vanilla JavaScript
- JS Class inheritance
- Fetching external data
- Async functionality and error handling
- Event propagation
- using Parcel bundler
- Organising project into separate files and modules

...and I learned that DOM manipulation is super tedious when trying to create more advanced projects.

  Working features:
- Add photo
- Add comment
- Add photo with description
- Like post
- Share image URL
- Fake save post
- Infinite scroll
