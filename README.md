I wanted to practice OOP programming in JS and prove myself in that language, so I made an Instagram copy

Things I honed in my JS knowledge during this project:
- Object oriented JS
- Custom Components in vanilla JavaScript
- Class inheritance
- Fetching external data
- Async functionality and error handling
- Event propagation
- using Parcel bundler
- Organising project into separate files and modules
